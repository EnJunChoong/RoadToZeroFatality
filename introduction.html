</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In SDG 3.6, the UN is committed to halve the road accident fatalities and injuries world wide. This Shiny application is created in 2019, within one year before the proposed deadline. We offer the UK public a visualization tool on the fatal road accidents in UK and the infographics associated with them. We hope that with this application, the UK public can be better informed about the current standing of fatal road accidents in UK, and subsequently make data driven decisions based on the insights provided.&nbsp;</span></p></html>
